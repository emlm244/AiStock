# Pass-1 Findings — docs/

- `docs/FSD_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` reflects pre-Option D architecture (autonomous FSD emphasis, legacy Q-learning enhancements) and conflicts with current safety-first coordinator/risk posture; needs rewrite or archival note to avoid misleading operators.
- `docs/BACKTEST_RERUN_GUIDE.md` aligns with current TradingEngine P&L correction workflow; verify referenced scripts still exist and integrate into Pass-3 regression tasks.
- `docs/OPTION_F_BROKER_RECONCILIATION.md` captures outstanding Option F roadmap; should sync with AGENTS.md backlog during later passes and drive task breakdown.
